🏃‍♂️ Real-Time Pose Estimation
📌 Overview

  This project implements real-time human pose estimation using Python and computer vision libraries. 
  It captures a webcam feed and predicts key body landmarks (joints such as head, shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.) in real time. 
  Pose estimation is a fundamental step in applications like activity recognition, fitness coaching, gesture-based interfaces, and sports analytics.
